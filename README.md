# challenge-jul-19: Work Day Scheduler (Save-events-calendar)

##Description

In this challenge, I have developed a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. 

I have used Moment.js library to implement date and time. I have also used Bootstrap to create the calendar and added various classes. 

It will do the following:

 - GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule. The planner shows the current day at the top of the calendar

- When I scroll down, then it shows the timeblocks for standard business hours

- Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past (grey), present (red), or future (green)

-When I click on "Add Events" on each timeblock, then I can enter events

-When I click on the save button for that timeblock, then the text for that event is saved in local storage

- The list of events also show as list on the page

-When I refresh the page, then the saved events persist
